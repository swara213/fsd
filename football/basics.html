        <aside>
            <h4>Early Modern Period</h4>
            <p>Football's roots extend back to ancient civilizations like China, Greece, and Rome, where various ball games existed. The modern game began to take shape in 19th-century England, with public schools developing standardized rules. The establishment of the Football Association (FA) in 1863 marked the codification of these rules, distinguishing association football from rugby.</p>

            <h4>Governing Body</h4>
            <p>The sport spread globally, driven by British influence through trade and colonization. The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw the formation of football clubs and leagues, with the English Football League starting in 1888. FIFA, founded in 1904, became the sport's global governing body.</p>

            <h4>Major Tournaments</h4>
            <p>The first FIFA World Cup in 1930 and the UEFA Champions League in 1955 cemented football's international appeal. Technological advancements like goal-line technology and VAR have modernized the game. Today, football is a global phenomenon, uniting millions of fans and players worldwide.</p>
