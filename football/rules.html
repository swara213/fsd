   <h4>Basic Rules of Football</h4>

    Objective
    <br>    
    The primary objective in football is to score more goals than the opponent within the 90-minute match duration, split into two halves of 45 minutes each, with a 15-minute halftime break.
    <br>
    <h5>The Field and Players</h5>
    - Field: A rectangular pitch with goals at each end.
    - Players: Each team has 11 players, including a goalkeeper.
    <br>
    <h5>Starting and Restarting Play</h5>
    - Kick-off: Used to start each half and after a goal is scored.
    - Throw-ins: Awarded when the ball crosses the sideline, taken by the team that did not touch the ball last.
    <br>
    <h5>Scoring</h5>
    A goal is scored when the entire ball crosses the goal line between the goalposts and beneath the crossbar.
    <br>
    <h5>Offside Rule</h5>
    A player is offside if they are nearer to the opponent's goal line than both the ball and the second last opponent when the ball is played to them, unless they are in their own half.
    <br>
    <h5>Fouls and Misconduct</h5>
    - Free Kicks: Awarded after most fouls, either direct (can score directly) or indirect (another player must touch the ball before a goal).
    - Penalty Kicks: Awarded for fouls within the penalty area, taken from the penalty spot.
    - Yellow and Red Cards: Issued for cautionable and sending-off offenses, respectively. Two yellow cards equal a red card, leading to ejection from the game.
    <br>
    <h5>Goalkeeper</h5>
    The goalkeeper is the only player allowed to use their hands, but only within the penalty area.

    Football's simplicity and clear rules contribute to its global popularity.
